      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
      <li>8 ounces udon noodles, or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 English cucumbers, sliced</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine sugar, water, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and salt in a small
        saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar and salt are dissolved,
        about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
        Stir in rice vinegar to make dressing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook udon noodles in boiling
        water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the
        bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water and drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer udon to a large bowl. Add cucumbers, shallot, red bell pepper,
        and Thai chile pepper. Pour dressing into the bowl; toss until salad is
        evenly coated. Let stand to marinate, at least 20 minutes, before
        serving.
      </li>
