    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I like making pie just as much as the next guy likes making pie, but I
      like making a galette even more. They're more fun, and I like the freedom
      that the rustic appearance affords. But mostly, I think I just enjoy the
      higher crust to fruit ratio. Serve with ice cream. .
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl with a pastry blender. Add
        cold butter and combine with the pastry blender until coarse crumbs
        form. Drizzle in cold water, a little at a time, stirring to combine
        with a fork, until dough comes together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough onto a work surface and bring together with your hands; press
        into a disk of dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper or a SilpatÂ® baking mat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and scornstarch in
        a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll on a lightly floured work
        surface into a 15-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place blueberry filling into the center of the dough, leaving 3 to 4
        inches of space around the border of dough. Fold dough up and around the
        berries, rotating a few inches and make another fold, overlapping the
        first; repeat around the dough until pleats are formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine beaten egg and water in a small bown and brush on the dough.
        Sprinkle on demerara sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the center of a preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
